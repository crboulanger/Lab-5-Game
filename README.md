# Welcome
This is the repository for my simple game.

Included are libraries for the LCD.
Also included are libraries for the Buttons.
Lastly included are libraries for Game header, main, and implementation.

### Description
This game involves a character represented by an '*' who's objective is to navigate from the start posistion 
at the top left of the LCD screen to the finish line at the bottom right of the LCD screen. But be careful not to
hit any mines or go over the 2 second time limit or the game is lost.

Further Functionality allows the user to:
- Use button interrupts (B-Functionality) 
- Navigate around mines (A-Functionality)
- Ensure the game is winable by deconflicting mines
- Add additional features to the game

#### Game Over?
No problem. Push any button again to start a new game.
